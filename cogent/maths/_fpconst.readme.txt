Utilities for handling IEEE 754 floating point special values

This python module implements constants and functions for working with
IEEE754 double-precision special values.  It provides constants for
Not-a-Number (NaN), Positive Infinity (PosInf), and Negative Infinity
(NegInf), as well as functions to test for these values.

The code is implemented in pure python by taking advantage of the
'struct' standard module. Care has been taken to generate proper
results on both big-endian and little-endian machines. Some efficiency
could be gained by translating the core routines into C.

See <http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/IEEE-754references.html>
for reference material on the IEEE 754 floating point standard.
