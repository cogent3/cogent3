def procrustes(data1, data2):
    """Procrustes analysis, a similarity test for two data sets.
    
    Each input matrix is a set of points or vectors (the rows of the matrix)
    The dimension of the space is the number of columns of each matrix.
    Given two identially sized matrices, procrustes standardizes both
    such that:
    - trace(AA') = 1  (A' is the transpose, and the product is
    a standard matrix product).
    - Both sets of points are centered around the origin
    
    Procrustes then applies the optimal transform to the second matrix
    (including scaling/dilation, rotations, and reflections) to minimize
    M^2 = sum(square(mtx1 - mtx2)), or the sum of the squares of the pointwise
    differences between the two input datasets
    
    If two data sets have different dimensionality (different number of
    columns), simply add columns of zeros the the smaller of the two.
    
    This function was not designed to handle datasets with different numbers of
    datapoints (rows)
    
    Arguments:
        - data1: matrix, n rows represent points in k (columns) space
        data1 is the reference data, after it is standardised, the data from
        data2 will be transformed to fit the pattern in data1
        - data2: n rows of data in k space to be fit to data1.  Must be the 
        same shape (numrows, numcols) as data1
        - both must have >1 unique points
        
    Returns:
        - mtx1: a standardized version of data1
        - mtx2: the orientation of data2 that best fits data1.
        centered, but not necessarily trace(mtx2*mtx2') = 1
        - disparity: a metric for the dissimilarity of the two datasets,
        disparity = M^2 defined above
        
    Notes:
        - The disparity should not depend on the order of the input matrices, 
        but the output matrices will, as only the first output matrix is
        guaranteed to be scaled such that trace(AA') = 1.
        - duplicate datapoints are generally ok, duplicating a data point will
        increase it's effect on the procrustes fit.
        - the disparity scales as the number of points per input matrix
