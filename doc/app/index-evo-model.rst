Modelling sequence evolution
============================

``cogent3`` possesses unique capabilities for molecular evolutionary analyses. Of particular significance are our non-stationary model classes and the associated measurement of genetic distance from these. That said, we also implement most of the conventional substitution models. See ``cogent3.available_models()`` for a display of the built-in models.

You can use these models either through the general ``model`` app, or some task specific apps. Both are described below.
