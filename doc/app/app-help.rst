.. _app_help:

Getting help on an app
======================

The ``app_help()`` function is a top-level import. It provides you with detailed help on an individual app. You pass the name of the app you want information on (:ref:`see available apps <available_apps>`) as a string. Below, I request help for the app ``omit_degenerates`` by passing that name as a string.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import app_help

    app_help("omit_degenerates")

The resulting vignette has multiple of sections.

#. "Overview" describes the app purpose.
#. "Options for making the app" shows how to create an app instance using ``get_app()`` (:ref:`get_app`). It includes the positional and keyword arguments for the app.
#. "Parameters" lists the documentation describing the arguments.
#. "Input type" states what data types are acceptable as input to the app.
#. "Output type" states what data type will be generated by the app.
