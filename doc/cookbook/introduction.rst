What we hope is clear from the Cookbook is that Cogent3 has extensive capabilities that cover for many areas of genomic biology.

If you have particular need of an example falling in any of the sections, please `post a ticket <https://github.com/cogent3/cogent3/issues>`_. Better yet, if you write one, please consider submitting it as a pull request to the Cogent3_ mercurial repository and we'll include it in Cogent3!
