Introduction

This cookbook is in it's early stages with the majority of sections not yet written. Rather than wait until it is complete before presenting it we provide it as is. Some sections are complete whilst those that remain to be written are indicated as such.

What we hope is clear from the Cookbook is that PyCogent has extensive capabilities that cover for many areas of genomic biology including, but not limited to: comparative genomics, metagenomics and systems biology.

If you have particular need of an example falling in any of the sections, please post a documentation request on the appropriate projects forums_ page. Better yet, if you write one and attach to such a posting we'll include it!
