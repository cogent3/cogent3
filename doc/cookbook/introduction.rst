Introduction

The cookbook remains incomplete with many sections not yet written. Rather than wait until it is complete before presenting it we provide it as is.

What we hope is clear from the Cookbook is that PyCogent has extensive capabilities that cover for many areas of genomic biology including, but not limited to: comparative genomics, metagenomics and systems biology.

If you have particular need of an example falling in any of the sections, please post a documentation request on the appropriate projects forums_ page. Better yet, if you write one and attach to such a posting we'll include it!
