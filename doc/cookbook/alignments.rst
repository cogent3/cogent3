Sequence Collections and Alignments
-----------------------------------

.. authors, Gavin Huttley, Kristian Rother, Patrick Yannul, Tom Elliott, Jan Kosinski

For loading collections of unaligned or aligned sequences see :ref:`load-seqs`.

What's the difference between ``Alignment`` and ``ArrayAlignment``?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Alignment`` class can be annotated, meaning you can add annotations to an Alignment or it's member sequences and you can slice the alignment via those objects. This capability is achieved, under the hood, by having the individual sequences represent gaps as a "span", rather than explicitly as a "-" character in the sequence itself. This representation is also efficient for very long sequences.

The ``ArrayAlignment`` class cannot be annotated. The class represents its sequences as a ``numpy.ndarray`` instance. Thus, the gaps are included as a state in the array. This class is better at handling a lot of sequences and should typically be faster. This is the default class returned by the ``load_aligned_seqs`` and ``make_aligned_seqs`` functions. (See :ref:`load-seqs` for details.)

You can change alignment types using the ``to_type()`` method.

    seqs

Adding new sequences to an existing collection or alignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New sequences can be either appended or inserted using the ``add_seqs`` method. More than one sequence can be added at the same time. Note that ``add_seqs`` does not modify the existing collection/alignment, it creates a new one.

Appending the sequences
"""""""""""""""""""""""

``add_seqs`` without additional parameters will append the sequences to the end of the collection/alignment.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import make_aligned_seqs

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        [("seq1", "ATGAA------"), ("seq2", "ATG-AGTGATG"), ("seq3", "AT--AG-GATG")],
        moltype="dna",
    )
    aln

.. jupyter-execute::

    new_seqs = make_aligned_seqs(
        [("seq0", "ATG-AGT-AGG"), ("seq4", "ATGCC------")], moltype="dna"
    )
    new_aln = aln.add_seqs(new_seqs)
    new_aln

.. note:: The order is not preserved if you use the ``to_fasta()`` method, which sorts sequences by name.

Inserting the sequences
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Sequences can be inserted into an alignment at the specified position using either the ``before_name`` or ``after_name`` arguments.

.. jupyter-execute::

    new_aln = aln.add_seqs(new_seqs, before_name="seq2")
    new_aln

.. jupyter-execute::

    new_aln = aln.add_seqs(new_seqs, after_name="seq2")
    new_aln

Inserting sequence(s) based on their alignment to a reference sequence
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Already aligned sequences can be added to an existing ``Alignment`` object and aligned at the same time using the ``add_from_ref_aln`` method. The alignment is performed based on their alignment to a reference sequence (which must be present in both alignments). The method assumes the first sequence in ``ref_aln.names[0]`` is the reference.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import make_aligned_seqs

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        [("seq1", "ATGAA------"), ("seq2", "ATG-AGTGATG"), ("seq3", "AT--AG-GATG")],
        moltype="dna",
    )
    ref_aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        [("seq3", "ATAGGATG"), ("seq0", "ATG-AGCG"), ("seq4", "ATGCTGGG")],
        moltype="dna",
    )
    new_aln = aln.add_from_ref_aln(ref_aln)
    new_aln

``add_from_ref_aln`` has the same arguments as ``add_seqs`` so ``before_name`` and ``after_name`` can be used to insert the new sequences at the desired position.

.. note:: This method does not work with the ``ArrayAlignment`` class.

Removing all columns with gaps in a named sequence

The elements of a collection or alignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Accessing individual sequences from a collection or alignment by name
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Using the ``get_seq`` method allows for extracting an unaligned sequence from a collection or alignment by name.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import make_aligned_seqs

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        [("seq1", "ATGAA------"), ("seq2", "ATG-AGTGATG"), ("seq3", "AT--AG-GATG")],
        moltype="dna",
        array_align=False,
    )
    seq = aln.get_seq("seq1")
    seq.name
    type(seq)
    seq.is_gapped()

Alternatively, if you want to extract the aligned (i.e., gapped) sequence from an alignment, you can use ``get_gapped_seq``.

.. jupyter-execute::

    seq = aln.get_gapped_seq("seq1")
    seq.is_gapped()
    seq

To see the names of the sequences in a sequence collection, use the ``names`` attribute.

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln.names

Slice the sequences from an alignment like a list
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The usual approach is to access a ``SequenceCollection`` or ``Alignment`` object as a dictionary, obtaining the individual sequences using the titles as "keys" (above).  However, one can also iterate through the collection like a list.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs, load_unaligned_seqs

    fn = "data/long_testseqs.fasta"
    seqs = load_unaligned_seqs(fn, moltype="dna")
    my_seq = seqs.seqs[0]
    my_seq[:24]

.. jupyter-execute::

    type(my_seq)

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln.seqs[0][:24]


Getting a subset of sequences from the alignment
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs

    aln = load_aligned_seqs("data/test.paml", moltype="dna")
    aln.names

.. jupyter-execute::

    new = aln.take_seqs(["Human", "HowlerMon"])
    new.names

.. note:: The ``Alignment`` class (which you get if you set ``array_align=False``) is more memory efficient. The subset contain references to the original sequences, not copies.

Extracting sequences by sequence identifier into a new alignment object
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can use ``take_seqs`` to extract some sequences by sequence identifier from an alignment to a new alignment object:

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs

    aln = load_aligned_seqs("data/long_testseqs.fasta")
    aln.take_seqs(["Human", "Mouse"])

Alternatively, you can extract only the sequences which are not specified by passing ``negate=True``:

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln.take_seqs(["Human", "Mouse"], negate=True)

Extracting sequences using an arbitrary function into a new alignment object
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can use ``take_seqs_if`` to extract sequences into a new alignment object based on whether an arbitrary function applied to the sequence evaluates to True. For example, to extract sequences which don't contain any N bases you could do the following:

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import make_aligned_seqs

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        data=[
            ("seq1", "ATGAAGGTG---"),

    def no_N_chars(s):
        return "N" not in s

    aln.take_seqs_if(no_N_chars)

You can additionally get the sequences where the provided function evaluates to False:

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln.take_seqs_if(no_N_chars, negate=True)

Getting motif counts

We state the motif length we want and whether to allow gap or ambiguous characters. The latter only has meaning for IPUAC character sets (the DNA, RNA or PROTEIN moltypes). We illustrate this for the DNA moltype with motif lengths of 1 and 3.

    counts

.. note::

    Only the observed motifs are returned, rather than all defined by the alphabet.

Computing motif probabilities from an alignment
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The method ``get_motif_probs`` of ``Alignment`` objects returns the probabilities for all motifs of a given length. For individual nucleotides:

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs

    aln = load_aligned_seqs("data/primate_cdx2_promoter.fasta", moltype="dna")
    motif_probs = aln.get_motif_probs()
    motif_probs

For dinucleotides or longer, we need to pass in an ``Alphabet`` with the appropriate word length. Here is an example with trinucleotides:

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import DNA, load_aligned_seqs

    trinuc_alphabet = DNA.alphabet.get_word_alphabet(3)
    aln = load_aligned_seqs("data/primate_cdx2_promoter.fasta", moltype="dna")
    motif_probs = aln.get_motif_probs(alphabet=trinuc_alphabet)
    for m in sorted(motif_probs, key=lambda x: motif_probs[x], reverse=True):
        print("%s  %.3f" % (m, motif_probs[m]))

The same holds for other arbitrary alphabets, as long as they match the alignment ``MolType``.

Some calculations in ``cogent3`` require all non-zero values in the motif probabilities, in which case we use a pseudo-count. We illustrate that here with a simple example where T is missing. Without the pseudo-count, the frequency of T is 0.0, with the pseudo-count defined as 1e-6 then the frequency of T will be slightly less than 1e-6.

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(data=[("a", "AACAAC"), ("b", "AAGAAG")], moltype="dna")
    motif_probs = aln.get_motif_probs()
    assert motif_probs["T"] == 0.0
    motif_probs = aln.get_motif_probs(pseudocount=1e-6)
    assert 0 < motif_probs["T"] <= 1e-6

It is important to notice that motif probabilities are computed by treating sequences as non-overlapping tuples. Below is a very simple pair of identical sequences where there are clearly 2 'AA' dinucleotides per sequence but only the first one is 'in-frame' (frame width = 2).

We then create a dinucleotide ``Alphabet`` object and use this to get dinucleotide probabilities. These frequencies are determined by breaking each aligned sequence up into non-overlapping dinucleotides and then doing a count. The expected value for the 'AA' dinucleotide in this case will be 2/8 = 0.25.

.. jupyter-execute::

    seqs = [("a", "AACGTAAG"), ("b", "AACGTAAG")]
    aln = make_aligned_seqs(data=seqs, moltype="dna")
    dinuc_alphabet = DNA.alphabet.get_word_alphabet(2)
    motif_probs = aln.get_motif_probs(alphabet=dinuc_alphabet)
    assert motif_probs["AA"] == 0.25

What about counting the total incidence of dinucleotides including those not in-frame?  A naive application of the Python string object's count method will not work as desired either because it "returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences".

.. jupyter-execute::

    seqs = [("my_seq", "AAAGTAAG")]
    aln = make_aligned_seqs(data=seqs, moltype="dna")
    my_seq = aln.get_seq("my_seq")
    my_seq.count("AA")
    "AAA".count("AA")
    "AAAA".count("AA")

To count all occurrences of a given dinucleotide in a DNA sequence, one could use a standard Python approach such as list comprehension:

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import make_seq

    seq = make_seq(moltype="dna", seq="AAAGTAAG")
    seq
    di_nucs = [seq[i : i + 2] for i in range(len(seq) - 1)]
    sum([nn == "AA" for nn in di_nucs])

    c1, c2 = list(col)
    c1, c2
    list(filter(lambda x: x == "-", c1))
    list(filter(lambda x: x == "-", c2))

Calculating the gap fraction

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs

    aln = load_aligned_seqs("data/primate_cdx2_promoter.fasta")
    for column in aln[113:150].iter_positions():
        ungapped = list(filter(lambda x: x == "-", column))
        gap_fraction = len(ungapped) * 1.0 / len(column)
        print(gap_fraction)

Extracting maps of aligned to unaligned positions (i.e., gap maps)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It's often important to know how an alignment position relates to a position in one or more of the sequences in the alignment. The ``gap_maps`` method of the individual sequences is useful for this. To get a map of sequence to alignment positions for a specific sequence in your alignment, do the following:

.. jupyter-execute::

    from cogent3 import make_aligned_seqs

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        data=[
            ("seq1", "ATGAAGG-TG--"),
            ("seq2", "ATG-AGGTGATG"),
            ("seq3", "ATGAAG--GATG"),
        ],
        moltype="dna",
    )
    seq_to_aln_map = aln.get_gapped_seq("seq1").gap_maps()[0]

It's now possible to look up positions in the ``seq1``, and find out what they map to in the alignment:

.. jupyter-execute::

    seq_to_aln_map[3]
    seq_to_aln_map[8]

This tells us that in position 3 in ``seq1`` corresponds to position 3 in ``aln``, and that position 8 in ``seq1`` corresponds to position 9 in ``aln``.

Notice that we grabbed the first result from the call to ``gap_maps``. This is the sequence position to alignment position map. The second value returned is the alignment position to sequence position map, so if you want to find out what sequence positions the alignment positions correspond to (opposed to what alignment positions the sequence positions correspond to) for a given sequence, you would take the following steps:

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln_to_seq_map = aln.get_gapped_seq("seq1").gap_maps()[1]
    aln_to_seq_map[3]
    aln_to_seq_map[8]

If an alignment position is a gap, and therefore has no corresponding sequence position, you'll get a ``KeyError``.

.. jupyter-execute::
    :raises: KeyError

    seq_pos = aln_to_seq_map[7]

.. note:: The first position in alignments and sequences is always numbered position 0.

Filtering alignments based on gaps
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: An alternate, computationally faster, approach to removing gaps is to use the ``filtered`` method as discussed in :ref:`filter-positions`.

The ``omit_gap_runs`` method can be applied to remove long stretches of gaps in an alignment. In the following example, we remove sequences that have more than two adjacent gaps anywhere in the aligned sequence.

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        data=[
            ("seq1", "ATGAA---TG-"),
            ("seq2", "ATG-AGTGATG"),
            ("seq3", "AT--AG-GATG"),
        ],
        moltype="dna",
    )
    aln.omit_gap_runs(2)

If instead, we just wanted to remove positions from the alignment which are gaps in more than a certain percentage of the sequences, we could use the ``omit_gap_pos`` function. For example:

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        data=[
            ("seq1", "ATGAA---TG-"),
            ("seq2", "ATG-AGTGATG"),
            ("seq3", "AT--AG-GATG"),
        ],
        moltype="dna",
    )
    aln.omit_gap_pos(0.40)

If you wanted to remove sequences which contain more than a certain percent gap characters, you could use the ``omit_gap_seqs`` method. This is commonly applied to filter partial sequences from an alignment.

.. jupyter-execute::

    aln = make_aligned_seqs(
        data=[
            ("seq1", "ATGAA------"),
            ("seq2", "ATG-AGTGATG"),
            ("seq3", "AT--AG-GATG"),
        ],
        moltype="dna",
    )
    filtered_aln = aln.omit_gap_seqs(0.50)
    filtered_aln

Note that following this call to ``omit_gap_seqs``, the 4th column of ``filtered_aln`` is 100% gaps. This is generally not desirable, so a call to ``omit_gap_seqs`` is frequently followed with a call to ``omit_gap_pos`` with no parameters -- this defaults to removing positions which are all gaps:

.. jupyter-execute::

    filtered_aln.omit_gap_pos()
