cogent3_ is a software library for genomic biology. It is a comprehensive framework for manipulation of genomic sequence data and for conducting molecular evolutionary analyses. It is distinguished by many unique built-in capabilities. Of particular note are our non-stationary Markov substitution models. These include `non-stationary nucleotide <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25503772>`_, and `non-stationary codon <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28175284>`_ models.

Plus, the ability to manipulate biological sequences by their annotations.

    ``cogent3`` apps
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    ``cogent3`` comes with pre-defined "apps" that simplify otherwise complex tasks. They provide capabilities that can be used by themselves, or added together to define a pipeline. They also simplify parallel execution of pipelines.
