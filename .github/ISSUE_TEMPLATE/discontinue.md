What function, method or argument should be marked for change?

What is the full module path to the attribute?

**Why**

Why should it be discontinued?

**How much notice**

The number of months (*x*) long before the capability will be removed? This should be represented in the user warning as a specific version. e.g. <current year>.<current month + *x*> where *x* is from the PR date.  

**Guidelines for deprecation**

As this is a discontinued function, see [dev guidelines for deprecation](https://github.com/cogent3/c3dev/wiki/Deprecating-Code) of code. Indicate the limiting version (for when the old function will be removed) as 3 months from when you make the change.
