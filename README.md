# PyCogent3

This is the port of PyCogent to Python 3. There are massive changes to the library beyond just Python 3 compatibility.

## What's New?

There are a large number of significant differences to the PyCogent version 1.9 release (which is only compatible with python 2). Please check the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/pycogent3/cogent3/wiki/Home) for a list of the major API changes.
