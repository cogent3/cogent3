# NOTICE

We will be departing Bitbucket for GitHub soon due to their recent decision to drop support for mercurial. Stay tuned for details.

## PyCogent3 â†’Cogent3

This is the port of PyCogent to Python 3, it's being renamed to Cogent3 as it has been rewritten extensively and `cogent` was always been the import name (dating back to 2004!).

## What's New?

A massive amount!

We integrated many of the new developments on modelling of non-stationary processes published by the Huttley lab over the last decade.

We have implemented a `cogent3.app` module which contains very different capabilities. Notably, a functional programming style interface for many capabilities to lower the effort for using cogent3's advanced capabilities. These are as yet documented.

Importantly, the app interface should be considered as alpha level code. Documentation for these new features will follow in the next few weeks.

## What's Changed?

There are massive changes to the library since the PyCogent version 1.9 release (which is only compatible with python 2).

Please check the wiki for a list of the major API changes, but note that as of August 23, 2019 that Wiki is now very much out-of-date.

We will update as soon as possible.

## Documentation

PyCogent3 documentation is on [readthedocs](https://cogent3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
