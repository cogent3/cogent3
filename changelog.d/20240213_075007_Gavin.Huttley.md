### Contributors

- Katherine Caley for reviewing PRs and code contributions
  related to SeqView taking on a more prominent role in recording
  history of operations on sequences.



### ENH

- Annotation databases are now preserved after renaming sequences.
  This is made possible because SeqView has the seqid attribute which
  is preserved and is independent of the name of the enclosing Sequence.
- Sequence.parent_coordinates() now returns information related to its
  parent. For example, we have a sequence with name "1" which we then
  sliced and rename the slice to "gene". Calling gene.parent_coordinates()
  would return "1", slice start, slice end, strand.
