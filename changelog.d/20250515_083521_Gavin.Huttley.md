### Enhancements

- Dotplots now show the alignment path whenever Alignment.dotplot() is invoked.
  Previously, the path was only displayed if there gaps, which could be confusing
  since that's behaviour of SequenceCollection.dotplot().


### Bug fixes

- Alignment paths were incorrectly displayed on dotplots when invoked from the
  dotplot method. This has been fixed.
