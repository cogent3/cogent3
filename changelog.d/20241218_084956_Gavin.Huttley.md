### ENH

- Improved load balancing in parallel execution of new_alignment.Alignment.distance_matrix
  calculations. This can deliver pretty substantial speedups for large numbers of sequences.

- Major effort in improving compatability of new_type core objects with the
  rest of the codebase. There remain some missing capabilities, and some edge-case
  test failures. However, the core functionality is now working.

### Deprecations

- The nominated release for setting new_type=True as the default for new
  core objects has been pushed back to 2025.1. This will allow time for
  the remaining issues to be resolved.

- All annotate_from_gff() methods are deprecated, they will be removed in 2025.6.
  Users should assign the result of cogent3.load_annotations() to the object's
  annotation_db attribute, or provide the annotation_path argument to the standard
  load_(un)aligned_seqs() functions.
