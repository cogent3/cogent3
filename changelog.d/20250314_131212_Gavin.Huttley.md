  and @je634 👏🚀🎉

### ENH

- The cogent3.core.annotation.Feature class now gets an xattr property.
  This allows developers to pack additional data into the Feature object
  without compromising the core API.
- cogent3 now supports hook-style plugins🎉. The first hook is for computing
  quick_tree() trees. This method is on our alignment class and on our distance
  matrix class. It currently defaults to the cogent3 quick_tree() app, which
  applies the NJ algorithm. For developers, you can see what hooks are supported
  by looking in cogent3._plugin at functions named `get_<something>_hook()`. All
  third-party hooks must adhere to the cogent3 app interface.

  Developers, register your hook by adding a section `[project.entry-points."cogent3.hook"]`
  section to your `pyproject.toml` file. Assign to the hook name (e.g. `quick_tree`) the string
  reference to the app supporting the hook. For example,
  `quick_tree = "my_package.my_module.my_quick_tree_app"`.

  Users, specify which package you want to use by setting `<obj>.quick_tree(use_hook="<package name>")`.
  For example, `use_hook="my_package"` would invoke the one defined above. Set `use_hook="cogent3"`
  to force using the cogent3 default.

### Discontinued

- new_alignment.Alignment.quick_tree() no longer supports doing bootstraps.
  This is because bootstrapping is not quick! If you want this, post a feature
  request and we will implement a separate app for this.
