### Contributors

- rmcar17, fixed display of support in dendrograms
- GavinHuttley, assorted


### Enhancements

- PhyloNode.rooted() and TreeNode.rooted() now return trees that bifurcate
  at a named edge. Addresses an issue rasied by @xonq -- thanks!
- Dendrogram(support_is_percent=True) argument means that thresholds and support
  statistics on dendrograms are treated as percentages. These are rounded to the
  nearest integer for display. This is now the default.

### Bug fixes

- cogent3.util.parallel.is_master_process() now works correctly
  when running using MPI. This was affecting the ability to create
  data stores when running with MPI.
- fix for displaying support statistics on dendrograms
