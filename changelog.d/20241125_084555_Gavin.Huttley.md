### Contributors

- Many thousand lines of code --- @KatherineCaley ðŸš€


### ENH

- The grand rewrite of alignment classes is ready for use! This is a major effort,
  unifying the capabilities of the `Alignment` and `AlignmentArray` classes into a
  single class. The logic is cleaner, the performance is better, and the API is
  largely (but not entirely) backwards compatible. The new approach gives us the
  foundation for major performance improvements in the future. As with the
  moltype, alphabet, genetic code and SequenceCollection, you can select the new
  class via `make_aligned_seqs()` or `load_aligned_seqs()` by specifying new_type=True.
  Please post any bugs or issues to the issue tracker.
