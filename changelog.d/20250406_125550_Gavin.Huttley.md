### ENH

- new type `SequenceCollection` and `Alignment` classes now have
  a public `name_map` property. This records the mapping between
  the sequence names in the collection and the names in the
  underlying seqsdata container. This is required for using annotations.
  The attribute is produced by the `rename_seqs()` method. `name_map`
  is an immutable dictionary.
