### ENH

- new type `SequenceCollection` and `Alignment` classes now have
  a public `name_map` property. This records the mapping between
  the sequence names in the collection and the names in the
  underlying seqsdata container. This is required for using annotations.
  The attribute is produced by the `rename_seqs()` method. `name_map`
  is an immutable dictionary.

### Discontinued

- We have changed the API for the SupportsFeatures protocol. It no longer
  inherits from SerialisableType. Thus, subclasses of AnnotationDbABC no
  longer have to implement `to_rich_dict()`, `from_dict()` and
  `to_json()` methods.
- We have changed the API for AnnotationDbABC. The following methods
  have been converted from abstractmethods to concrete methods. The
  concrete methods raise a NotImplementedError. This means
  developers need not implement them in their subclasses. The methods are:
  - `add_feature()`
  - `add_records()`
  - `subset()`
  - `update()`
  - `union()`
