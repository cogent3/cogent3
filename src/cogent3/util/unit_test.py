"""Extension of the built-in unittest framework for floating-point comparisons.

Specific Extensions:

assertFloatEqual, assertFloatEqualAbs, and assertFloatEqualRel give fine-
grained control over how floating point numbers (or lists thereof) are tested
for equality.

assertContains and assertNotContains give more helpful error
messages when testing whether an observed item is present or absent in a set
of possiblities. Ditto assertGreaterThan, assertLessThan, and assertIsProb.

assertSameItems and assertEqualItems test the items in a list
for pairwise identity and equality respectively (i.e. the observed and
expected values must have the same number of each item, though the order can
differ).

assertSimilarMeans and assertSimilarFreqs allow you to test stochastic results
by setting an explicit P-value and checking that the result is not improbable
given the expected P-value. Please use these instead of guessing confidence
intervals! The major advantage is that you can reset the P-value gloabally over
the whole test suite, so that rare failures don't occur every time.
