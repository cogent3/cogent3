# Comments on design
# the revised mutual information calculations are based on a sequence alignment
# represented as a numpy uint8 array.

# The resampled mutual information calculation uses a cache of all entropy terms
# from the independent and joint position, produced by _calc_entropy_components().
# For each combination of alternate possible states, there are two values in the
# entropy terms that need to be modified. These calculations are done by
# _calc_updated_entropy() and _calc_temp_entropy(). This caching, plus the
# numba.jit compilation, makes rmi competitive performance-wise with the other
# methods.

    This function allows for calculation of coevolve scores between
     pairs of alignments. The results are returned in a rectangular
     len(alignment1) x len(alignment2) matrix.

    There are some complications involved in preparing alignments for
     this function, because it needs to be obvious how to associate the
     putative interacting sequences. For example, if looking for
     interactions between mammalian proteins A and B, sequences are
     required from the same sets of species, and it must be apparant how
     to match the sequences that are most likely to be involved in
     biologically meaningful interactions. This typically means matching
     the sequences of proteins A&B that come from the same species. In
     other words, interaction of T. aculeatus proteinA and
     H. sapien proteinB likely don't form a biologically relevant
     interaction, because the species are so diverged.

     Matching of sequences is performed via the identifiers, but it is
     the responsibility of the user to correctly construct the sequence
     identifiers before passing the alignments (and tree, if applicable)
     to this function. To faciliate matching sequence identifiers, but not
     having to discard the important information already present in a
     sequence identifier obtained from a database such as KEGG or RefSeq,
     sequence identifiers may contain a plus symbol (+). The characters
     before the + are used to match sequences between the alignments and
     tree. The characters after the + are ignored by this function. So, a
     good strategy is to make the text before the '+' a taxonomic
     identifier and leave the text after the '+' as the original sequence
     identifier. For example, your sequence/tip names could look like:

     alignment1: 'H. sapien+gi|123', 'T. aculeatus+gi|456'
     alignment2: 'T. aculeatus+gi|999', 'H. sapien+gi|424'
     tree: 'T. aculeatus+gi|456', 'H. sapien'

     If there is no plus, the full sequence identifier will be used for the
     matching (see H. sapien in tree).  The order of sequences in the
     alignments is not important. Also note that we can't split on a colon,
     as would be convenient for pulling sequences from KEGG, because colons
     are special characters in newick.

     A WORD OF WARNING ON SEQUENCE IDENTIFIER CONSTRUCTION:
     A further complication is that in some cases, an organism will have
     multiple copies of proteins involved in a complex, but proteinA from
     locus 1 will not form a functional comples with proteinB from locus 2.
     An example of this is the three T6SSs in P. aeuroginosa. Make sure
     this is handled correctly when building your sequence identifiers!
     Sequence identifiers are used to match the sequences which are
     suspected to form a functional complex, which may not simply mean
     sequences from the same species.

    The idea is that when a position achieved a high covariation score

     from the phylogeny than from coevolution. They illustrate that this
     works in their paper, and I plan to test it with my alpha-helix-based

    The term parsimony informative comes from Codoner, O'Dea,

     show up at least twice each are ignored (i.e., treated as though
     there is not enough information) the positive predictive value
     (PPV) and sensitivity (SN) increase on simulated alignments. They
     term this quality parsimony informative.
     I implemented this as a filter, but include some generalization.
     To determine if a column in an alignment is parsimony informative
     in the exact manner described in Codoner et al., the following

     can be passed in so at least minimum_differences different amino
     acids must show up, and each amino acid must show up at least
     minimum_count times.
     In additional variation, strict=False can be passed requiring
     that only minimum_differences number of amino acids show up at least
     minimum_counts times (opposed to requiring that ALL amino acids show
     up minimum_counts times). This is the default behavior.
     By default, the default exclude characters (- and ?) don't count.
