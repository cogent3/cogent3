alphabet.py

Contains classes for representing alphabets, and more general ordinations that
map between a set of symbols and indices for storing the results in tables.
The provided alphabets are those encountered in biological sequences, but other
alphabets are certainly possible.

WARNING: do access the standard alphabets directly. It is expected that you
will access them through the appropriate moltype. Until the moltype module
has been imported, the alphabets will not know their MolType, which will
cause problems. It is often useful to create alphabets
and/or Enumerations on the fly, however.

        - Uses self.array_type to figure out the type of array to return (e.g.
